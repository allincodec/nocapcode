- **Java 24 Features**: Leverages modern features introduced in Java 24 to build concise and performant solutions.
- **Well-Organized Files**: Each problem solution is housed in its own dedicated file for easy navigation.
- **Efficiency-Oriented Approaches**: Optimized code to handle edge cases and efficiently solve problems.
- **Readable and Maintainable**: Follows clean coding standards for better readability and maintainability.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

1. **Java Development Kit (JDK) 24**  
   [Download Java 24](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)

2. **Build Tool (Optional)**  
   Although any text editor or IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA) can be used to run the Java programs, a build tool like Maven or Gradle can enhance the development process.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-structures-algorithms.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd data-structures-algorithms
   ```

3. Compile and run the files using the Java Compiler:
