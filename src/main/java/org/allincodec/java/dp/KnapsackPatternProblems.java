/**
 * Dynamic Programming Problems - 0/1 Knapsack Pattern
 *
 * This class contains method signatures and documentation for various dynamic programming problems
 * that follow the 0/1 Knapsack pattern, where each element can either be included or excluded
 * from the solution.
 *
 * The 0/1 Knapsack pattern is characterized by:
 * - Binary choice for each element (include/exclude)
 * - Optimal substructure property
 * - Overlapping subproblems
 * - State transition based on previous decisions
 * <p>
 * Problems explored in this 0/1 Knapsack pattern:
 * <p>
 *  0/1 Knapsack
 *       ├── Target Sum
 *       ├── Subset Sum
 *       ├── Count of Subset Sum
 *       ├── Minimum Subarray Sum Difference
 *       ├── Minimum Number of Refueling Stops
 *       ├── Equal Sum Subarrays
 *       ├── Count Square Submatrices
 * <p>
 * All problems stem from the core 0/1 Knapsack principle where each element
 * presents a binary decision point, leading to optimal solutions through
 * dynamic programming approaches.
 * <p>
 * Pattern Recognition:
 * - When you see "subset", "partition", or "choose/not choose" → Consider 0/1 Knapsack
 * - When optimizing with constraints → often maps to knapsack variants
 * - When counting ways to achieve a target → Usually subset sum variations
